A Norbert's Gambit (NG) calculator. NG is a special method for Canadian investors to exchange between CAD and USD that outperforms traditional FX trades by saving on broker fees. The calculator uses market data to calculate USD/CAD proceeds from executing NG and the estimated savings from using NG instead of using the bank or broker.
